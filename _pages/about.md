I am a computational neuroscientist and PhD student in the Integrated Program in Neuroscience in the lab of [Dr. Anmar Khadra](https://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/physio/khadralab/) at McGill University. I am interested in the neuronal excitability and dynamics at the single neuron and network level. I have a B.Sc Hons in Neuroscience from the University of Alberta and a Master of Science in Neural and Behavioural Science from the Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen in Tübingen, Germany.
